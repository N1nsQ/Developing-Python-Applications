# Developing-Python-Applications

This repository includes lot of small python applications that I created when participating **Developing Python Applications** course. The course started with Python basics including variables, data types, operators, loops, decision making, lists, arrays, functions, and exceptions. After the basics there was a part for object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance. Last part of the course was for graphical interface where tkinter were used.   

- Programs with prefix ```func_``` includes some kind of function.
- Programs with prefix ```class_ ```includes program where claases are used.
- Programs with prefix ```gui_``` includes program where tkinter is used for graphical interface.

The course was a good mix of very simple programs with few lines of code to challenging tasks where I really had do think how to come up with some solution.

## Course Content

- Python basics

- File handling
- Special topics: testing methods, exceptions, plotting

## Check out

There are lot of programs so I wanted to high light few of them. You may be interested in these programs:
* ```time_conventer.py```
  * This program converts given seconds to hours, minutes and seconds left.
* ```triangle.py```
  * Programs asks length for every side of a triangle. After that it tells if the triangle is right agnled, isosceles, equilaterial, acute or obtuse. The program also tells if it is not possible to create triangle with given values.
* ```find_biggest.py```
  * This program shows three different ways to find out biggest of three given numbers.
* ```account_manager.py```
  * This program works in command line. First the program asks for a PIN code, which is 0000. If the PIN is correct, programs opens for more actions. If the PIN is incorrect, user can try again three times. After that the program closes itself.
  * With right PIN code user can check the account balance, make a deposit or a withdrawal.
  * After a deposit, programs asks if user wants to do another deposit
  * When user makes a withdrawal, program first checks the account balance. If the saldo is smaller that withdrawal amount, program tells user a current saldo and asks if user wants to try again or leave.
  * User can close the program any time by pressin Q.
  * User can check current saldo by pressing S
* ```func_standard_deviation.py```
  * The program includes a function that calculates the standard deviation of given numbers and put them in a list. Function returns the list.
* ```func_factorial.py```
  * A function that returns the factorial of given number.
  * This function is used in few other programs
* ```func_nepers_value.py```
  * This function calculates an approximation of Euler's number.
  * Function created earlier / func_factorial.py / is used here.
* ```gui_morse_coder.py```
  * This program uses tkinter for graphical interface
  * With this program user can translate morse code to england (normal letter) or england to morse.

All assignments where classes are used can be found with name ```class_something.py```. Those programs are bigger and more complex and I am considering to move them to seperate repository.

## What did I learn?

Every programming course I have participated has given me more confidence and this was no exception. I had some experience with python basics but after my maternity leave, I felt I had forgotten everything I have ever learned. Doing these exercises showed that I was wrong, and my brain still works! It was good practice to run through the basics again but after that there were lots of new things to learn.  

I learned a lot about Python classes and inheritance. I had some basic knowledge about Python classes before the course, but I hadn’t really used them before. There were few good exercises that helped me to really understand classes.  

A GUI part of this course was all new to me. I had written only command line programs before, and it was very exciting to create a graphical interface. After all there were not that much time for this last part so I’m looking for to continue learning.
