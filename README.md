# Developing-Python-Applications

These small Python programs I made when participating **Developing Python Applications** course. The course was a good mix of very simple programs with few lines of code to challenging tasks where I really had do think how to come up with some solution.

## Course Content

- Python basics
- Object Oriented Programming
- Graphical User Interface
- File handling
- Special topics: testing methods, exceptions, plotting

## What did I learn?

Every programming course I have participated has given me more confidence and this was no exception. I had some experience with python basics but after my mothernity leave I felt I had forgotten everything I ever learned. Doing these exercises showed that I was wrong and my brain still works!  

At the beginning of this course I wasn't that familiar with Python classes, but there were few great assingments that made me figure out what it's all about. You might want to check out at least **class_house.py**. Also GUI part of this course was all new to me. My earlier programming experience had been mostly command line and console programs so I felt that whole new world opened to me after this course. We used tkinter in this course. Even that the programs were quite simple (see for example **kids_math_game.py** ) they managed to wake up my interest to learn more.
